# Who am I?
Pin-Chung (Tony) Cheng is a Ph.D. student in the Division of Biological Sciences at UC San Diego. He grew up in Taichung, Taiwan and enjoys the beautiful nature and tasty local foods in his hometown. He received his M.D. degree from Kaohsiung Medical University and completed his internship in Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital. Feeling limited by the current medical technology and the need to better understand diseases, Pin-Chung went on to study neurodegenerative disease in Yun-Ru Chen Lab at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. There he developed his skills in biochemistry and molecular biology and applied them to investigate the role of misfolded protein in ALS and Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Afterwards, Pin-Chung completed a M.S. degree in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine at University of Southern California, where he studied how metabolism can influence muscle stem cell aging in Joseph Rodger Lab. Currently at UC San Diego, Pin-Chung is developing an interest in bioinformatics and the rapidly advancing field of single-cell genomics. He plans on using a novel single-cell assay and computational analysis to identify genetic mutations and pathways that drive cancer growth. He believes by applying these single-cell technologies, we can build a massive library of disease database that will help us gain remarkable insight into disease mechanisms and lay the foundation for developing precision medicine that will improve patient outcome.
